Statement:
Anything that gets processed and executed is called as statement.
We can have more than one statement in a line but they have to be separated using (;)
console.log("Hi"); console.log("Welcome");

Semicolon:
It is not mandatory to use semicolon to end the statement. 
But when it involves complex processing as the one mentioned below, we need semicolon.

Example:
alert("Hello")
[1,2].forEach(alert);

Note: Always end the statement using semicolon.

Comments:
