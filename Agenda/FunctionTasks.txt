1. Create a function that takes a number as an input and check whether it is an even number or odd number

if a number divided by 2 gives 0 as remainder then it is even number
else the number is odd

Algorithm:
Step 1: Create a function that takes a number as input
Step 2: divide the number by 2 and check whether the remainder is 0
        if (number % 2 == 0)
Step 3: If true "display the output it is even"
Step 4: If false "display the ooutput it is odd"
Step 5: Make a function call to verify

function odd_even(number){
    if (number % 2 == 0){
        console.log(`Given number ${number} is even`);
    }
    else{
        console.log(`Given number ${number} is odd`);
    }
}
