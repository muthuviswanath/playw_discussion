Create a function that takes a number as input and gives the output as follows:
    If the number is prime number, it displays "Given number is prime"
    Else it displays "Given number is composite"

Prime number is a number that has exactly two factors (1 and the number itself)
a number that is completely divisible by 1 and itself is called as prime number

2 - prime number

2 % 1 = 0
2 % 2 = 0

9 % 1 = 0
9 % 2 = 1
9 % 3 = 0
9 % 4 = 1
9 % 5 = 4
9 % 6 = 3
9 % 7 = 2
9 % 8 = 1
9 % 9 = 0

[1,3,9] are the factors of 9 and so it is not a prime number

Step 1: Create a function that takes a number as input
Step 2: create a variable to store the number of factors
Step 3: Create a loop that starts from 1 and goes till the number
Step 4: Take the given number and divide it by the loop variable
Step 5: If the remainder is 0, then increment the number of factors
Step 6: After the loop check whether the value of the number of factors is exactly 2
Step 7: If the number of factors is exactly 2 then print "It is a prime number"
Step 8: Else print "It is a composite number"
Step 9: Call the function to verify
